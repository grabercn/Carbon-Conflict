# Carbon Conflict - Game Concept & Ideas

## 🌍 Setting Concept: Earth's Last Warzones
The year is 2145. Rising seas have swallowed nations. Deserts now cover half the continents. What remains of humanity has split into warring factions, each with a different vision for how to “save” the planet — or themselves.

Battles aren’t just against armies, but against the very land itself:
- **Floods destroy entire squads.**
- **Wildfires shift across the map.**
- **Toxic storms force temporary ceasefires.**

Victory isn’t just about capturing bases — it’s about securing the last viable ecosystems.

## 🌦️ Faction Ideas
1. **The Green Order** - Eco-terrorists who wield bio-weapons, living machines, and terrain-altering tech (turn battlefields into forests or coral reefs).
2. **The Last Coalition** - Militarized survivors from the old governments, clinging to fossil-fueled weaponry and scorched earth tactics.
3. **The Aqua Pact** - Floating cities turned pirate-nations, controlling water-based units and amphibious troops.
4. **The Sunborn** - Desert-dwelling nomads with solar-powered machines, sandships, and weather control devices.
5. **Gaia's Wrath** - Rogue AI-guided eco-drones that turn the planet itself against all factions — wildfires, animal swarms, earthquakes.

## ⚔️ Gameplay/Map Mechanics
- **Dynamic Weather**: Heatwaves, acid rain, flooding can change the map mid-battle.
- **Resource Scarcity**: Players must control limited water, fertile land, or energy sources.
- **Terraforming Units**: Some units can reforest land, drain floodwaters, or even cause natural disasters to sabotage enemies.

## 🌎 Name & Theme
**Game Name:** Carbon Conflict

| Name | Vibe |
|---|---|
| **Carbon Conflict** | Industrial collapse vs eco-rebellion |

## 🔥 Bonus Twist
What if the **players’ actions in battle affect future maps**?
- Burn forests for a quick win, but the next map is drier and harsher.
- Spare wetlands and they provide future bonuses.
- Units could have a **carbon footprint**, influencing global conditions game-wide.

## Next Steps
- Expand on faction backstories.
- Develop unit types and special abilities.
- Design initial maps with dynamic climate effects.
- Create concept art and unit sprites.
