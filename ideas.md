# Carbon Conflict - Game Concept and Ideas

## 🌍 Setting Overview
**Carbon Conflict** takes place in the year 2145, after decades of unchecked climate change and environmental collapse. The Earth's ecosystems have been pushed to the brink — deserts have swallowed cities, oceans have risen to claim coastlines, and storms ravage the last remaining habitable zones. In this shattered world, humanity's last factions battle for survival, ideology, and control of Earth’s fragile future.

Battles aren't just against enemy armies, but against the very planet itself. Floods, wildfires, toxic storms, and resource scarcity all play a role in the tactics needed to survive and win.

## ⚔️ Factions

### 1. The Green Order
- Eco-terrorists turned militant eco-preservationists.
- Use bio-weapons, living machines, and terraformers that can grow forests or coral reefs mid-battle.
- Idealists who believe nature must rule again — even if it means human extinction.

### 2. The Last Coalition
- A militarized remnant of the world’s former superpowers.
- Clings to fossil fuels, scorched earth tactics, and industrial weaponry.
- Views technology and military might as the only way forward.

### 3. The Aqua Pact
- Floating city-states that formed after rising seas swallowed coastal nations.
- Masters of amphibious warfare, water-based vehicles, and underwater ambush tactics.
- They fight to secure the last freshwater reserves.

### 4. The Sunborn
- Desert nomads who adapted to the harshest conditions.
- Solar-powered vehicles, sandships, and weather manipulation tech.
- Thrive on heatwaves and turning deserts into tactical advantage.

### 5. Gaia’s Wrath
- Rogue AI eco-drones, originally designed to restore the planet — now they see humanity as the disease.
- Use swarms of autonomous wildlife, nanobot storms, and controlled natural disasters.
- Neutral faction that attacks all sides, adding unpredictability to every map.

## 🌦️ Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Dynamic Weather
- Each map has evolving weather: 
    - Heatwaves dry up water sources.
    - Acid rain damages both units and terrain.
    - Flash floods alter movement paths.
    - Wildfires spread dynamically, blocking routes or destroying cover.

### Resource Scarcity
- Control limited:
    - Water sources.
    - Fertile land.
    - Renewable energy nodes (solar farms, wind turbines).
- Factions must choose between hoarding resources for themselves or restoring the environment.

### Terraforming & Environmental Manipulation
- Units can:
    - Reforest dead zones (providing cover and carbon reduction bonuses).
    - Drain floodwaters to reclaim land.
    - Ignite or control wildfires to cut off enemies.
- These actions have **long-term consequences on future maps**, affecting global climate conditions.

### Carbon Footprint System
- Every unit, building, and action has a **Carbon Cost**.
- High emissions increase global temperature, unlocking more extreme weather events.
- Low emissions may restore certain regions or provide long-term advantages.

## 🎖️ Sample Campaign Structure
- Campaign begins with localized resource skirmishes but escalates into global-scale eco-warfare.
- Players must balance **military objectives** with **climate consequences**.
- Victory isn’t just about defeating enemies — it’s about preserving enough of the planet to have something left to rule.

## 🌎 Possible Map Types
- Drowned Cityscapes (half-submerged skyscrapers with naval/amphibious focus).
- Scorched Earth Oilfields (high carbon cost but rich in energy).
- Melting Polar Outposts (fighting over the last ice).
- Toxic Swamps (home to mutated wildlife and unpredictable terrain shifts).

---

## 🧩 Thematic Hooks
- Every battle has **moral weight** — every missile, explosion, or wildfire pushes the planet closer to collapse.
- Player choices affect the **global climate meter**, which alters future missions and available resources.
- Alternate win condition: Can you win the war while **saving the planet** instead of destroying it?
